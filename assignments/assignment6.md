# Assignment 6

Due: see lecture plan

## Lab

This assignment is not a SEED lab.
    
You are given a firewall log file and tasked to investigate when a possible DDoS attack occurred. 

Download the log file ``fw_dmz.log.zip`` here: [fw_dmz.log.zip](fw_dmz.log.zip). Analyse it and try to find out when the attack started and stopped.

Note: The file unzips to 1.7GB! Hint: In Bash, consider using a combination of command-line tools such as ``less``, ``wc``, ``cat``, ``grep``, ``sort`` and ``uniq`` to analyse the file.

Describe your observations in a short report.

## Short answer questions

1. Compare forensics to incident response. What are the key similarities and differences?

2. When a file is deleted, is it typically erased or not erased from the media?

3. In forensics, what is slack space?

4. In data privacy, what is the difference between data generalization and data randomization?
